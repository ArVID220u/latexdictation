# First Blog Post

This is the first SayTeX blog post. Many more will come, hopefully. Maintaining this blog will (1) make me focused on achieving clear results, and (2) give the SayTeX project a well-documented history, both of which are admirable goals.

## The Current State of SayTeX

Since this is the first blog post, let us examine in what state SayTeX currently is in. For reference, SayTeX was conceptually redesigned a month ago: a vision to split the functionality into two separate levels, SayTeX Syntax and SayTeX+, was proposed, aiming to make the engine more robust and more extensible.

As of today, the compiler framework of SayTeX Syntax is implemented, and a small subset of common LaTeX commands have been added to the SayTeX Syntax dictionary. SayTeX+ has not yet been started.

## Next Steps

For SayTeX Syntax, more commands need to be added. This is not urgent and should not be the next step, though.

Rather, the next step should be to start implementing SayTeX+. A general idea for how it should work has already been laid out, but a more detailed plan needs to be created.

In case I need a break from SayTeX+, a parallel task that needs to be done is an update of the website. Particularly useful would be the addition of an input text field and a SayTeX Syntax text field, so as to not require voice input for testing purposes. Also, switching from MathJax to KaTeX would be good.
